## 📌 Project Overview
This research explores a secure, low-cost system that uses AI, computer vision, and IoT sensors to assess water quality in real-time. The goal is to empower individuals and underserved communities with tools to detect visible contaminants, assess microbial risks, and receive actionable health insights—all while protecting their privacy.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect water pollutants via smartphone image analysis
- Integrate external IoT sensors (pH, turbidity, nitrate, bacterial levels)
- Ensure secure data transmission using federated learning and TLS
- Apply SHAP and LIME for model interpretability
- Log data immutably using distributed ledger or blockchain
- Promote environmental health awareness in vulnerable regions

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- `TensorFlow Lite` – Mobile-based ML inference
- `IoT Integration` – pH/turbidity sensors via Bluetooth/WiFi
- `SHAP / LIME` – Explainable AI tools
- `Federated Learning` – For privacy-preserving training
- `Blockchain (optional)` – Tamper-proof data records
- `Firebase / AWS` – Secure data backend (with encryption)
